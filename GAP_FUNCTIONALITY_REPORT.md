# Gap and Functionality Report

## Current Functionality
- RoyaltyX provides key features including centralized revenue tracking, advanced analytics, content management and subscription management as listed in the README【F:README.md†L9-L16】.
- The platform runs on Django, React and Docker with Stripe payment processing at its core【F:README.md†L28-L50】.
- A full Stripe payment system is implemented with new user fields, dedicated payment endpoints and webhook processing【F:PAYMENT_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md†L1-L33】.
- The frontend includes a payment API layer and an updated membership page that handles checkout redirects and real‑time status updates【F:PAYMENT_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md†L38-L53】.

## Known Gaps
- The setup guide notes that webhooks do not reach the local environment so subscription plans fail to update automatically【F:STRIPE_SETUP_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md†L3-L6】.
- Webhook instructions recommend using ngrok or the Stripe CLI to forward events during development【F:WEBHOOK_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md†L1-L20】.
- In the Stripe service code, TODO comments show that notification emails for failed or cancelled payments are still missing【F:backend/apps/payments/stripe_service.py†L128-L156】.
- Future enhancement sections outline additional features like prorated billing, payment method management and annual billing discounts that are not yet implemented【F:STRIPE_PAYMENT_INTEGRATION.md†L205-L223】.
- The admin panel's messaging page is only a mockup without working functionality【F:frontend/src/modules/admin_panel/help_documentation/pages/Messaging.jsx†L6-L13】.
- Subscription plan documentation suggests future capabilities such as plan-specific restrictions and automatic plan changes【F:backend/SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS.md†L158-L165】.
