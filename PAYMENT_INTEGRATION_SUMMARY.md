See [documentation/DOCUMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md](documentation/DOCUMENTATION_OVERVIEW.md) for a full index of guides.


## üéâ Implementation Complete

I have successfully integrated Stripe payment processing into your RoyaltyX subscription system. Here's what has been implemented:

## ‚úÖ Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Schema
- **New Stripe fields** added to User model:
  - `stripe_customer_id` - Links user to Stripe customer
  - `stripe_subscription_id` - Tracks active subscription
  - `subscription_status` - Payment status (active, past_due, canceled, etc.)
  - `subscription_current_period_end` - Billing cycle end date
  - `grace_period_end` - Grace period for failed payments
  - `payment_failure_count` - Track payment failures

### 2. Payments App
- **New Django app**: `apps.payments`
- **Stripe Service Layer**: Handles all Stripe operations
- **API Endpoints**: Complete payment processing endpoints
- **Webhook Handler**: Processes Stripe events automatically

### 3. API Endpoints Created
```
POST /payments/create-checkout-session/  # Create Stripe checkout
POST /payments/cancel-subscription/      # Cancel subscription  
GET  /payments/subscription-status/      # Get detailed status
GET  /payments/verify-session/           # Verify payment session
POST /payments/stripe-webhook/           # Handle Stripe webhooks
```

### 4. Updated User Endpoints
- `POST /users/subscription-plan/change/` now handles payment flow:
  - **Discovery plan**: Direct downgrade (cancels Stripe subscription)
  - **Paid plans**: Returns payment required response with checkout URL

## ‚úÖ Frontend Integration

### 1. Payment API Layer
- **New file**: `frontend/src/modules/account/api/payments.js`
- Functions for all payment operations
- Proper error handling and authentication

### 2. Updated Membership Page
- **Stripe checkout integration**: Redirects to Stripe for payments
- **Return handling**: Processes success/cancel from Stripe
- **Real-time updates**: Verifies payments and updates UI
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error messages

### 3. Settings Modal Integration
- **Subscription tab**: Shows current plan with upgrade options
- **Multiple access points**: Users can manage subscriptions from anywhere

## üîÑ Payment Flow

### Upgrade Flow (Trial ‚Üí Paid)
1. User clicks "Upgrade" ‚Üí Confirmation dialog
2. User confirms ‚Üí API creates Stripe checkout session
3. User redirected to Stripe checkout page
4. User completes payment ‚Üí Stripe webhook fired
5. Backend processes webhook ‚Üí Updates user subscription
6. User redirected back ‚Üí Frontend verifies and shows success

### Downgrade Flow (Paid ‚Üí Discovery)

2. User confirms ‚Üí API cancels Stripe subscription
3. Backend updates user to discovery plan
4. Frontend shows success message

### Payment Failure Handling

2. Backend updates status to `past_due`
3. User enters grace period (7 days)
4. If not resolved ‚Üí Automatic downgrade to discovery

## üîß Configuration Required
