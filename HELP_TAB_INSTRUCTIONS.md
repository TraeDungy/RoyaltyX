# In-App Help Tab Guide

RoyaltyX includes a dedicated **Help Documentation** tab to make onboarding easy. The help tab contains collapsible cards that animate smoothly as you expand or hide them. Each card focuses on a specific part of the setup process so you can follow along without cluttering the screen.

## Opening the Help Tab
1. Start the application and sign in.
2. Click **Help Documentation** in the left sidebar. This opens the help tab.

## Using the Help Cards
- Click a card header to reveal its detailed instructions. Click again to hide it.
- Multiple cards can stay open at the same time, so you can jump between topics.
- The cards use subtle animations to appear and collapse, keeping the interface unobtrusive.

### Example Topics
- Configure environment variables
- Connect your first data source
- Invite team members
- Generate initial reports

Use these cards as a step-by-step checklist when setting up your instance of RoyaltyX. If you need further assistance, reach out through the support channels listed in the README.
