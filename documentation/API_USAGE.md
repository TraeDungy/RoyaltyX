# API Usage Guide

This short guide explains how to authenticate and send requests to the RoyaltyX API.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require JWT authentication. Obtain access and refresh tokens via `/authentication/token/`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/authentication/token/ \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "yourpassword"}'
```

Use the returned `access` token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests:

```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/projects/ \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'
```

## Interactive Docs
