# Analytics Data Overview

RoyaltyX stores raw sales and impression data and calculates aggregated metrics when needed.

## Stored Data

- **ProductSale**: records each purchase or rental, including unit price, quantity, royalty amount and reporting dates.
- **ProductImpressions**: tracks impression counts and eCPM for every product over a date range.

## Calculated on Demand

- Totals like total impressions, total revenue and number of sales.
- Time-based statistics (yearly, monthly, daily or hourly) generated by the `calculate_*_stats` functions.
- Per-source analytics created by `calculate_analytics_per_source`.

These values are computed at request time to keep the database lightweight and ensure the dashboard always reflects the latest data.
